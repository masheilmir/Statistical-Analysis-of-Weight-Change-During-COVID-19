# Statistical Analysis of Weight Change During COVID-19

After creating and distributing a survey, statistical analysis was performed to determine if indivduals in Ontario, specifically the GTA (Greater Toronto Area) have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic physically. I have delved into compare each indivduals eating habits, exercise habits, etc. to determine if, on average, people are gaining or losing more weight.
After conducting t-test analysis, a conclusion was made that aligned with our assumption that many have gained weight as a result of the closures across the province, forcing them to stay inside.
